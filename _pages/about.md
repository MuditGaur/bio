I am a PhD student in statistics at Purdue University. I am being advised by [Professor Vaneet Aggarwal](https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=119657) and [Professor Raghu Pasupathy](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/people/faculty/pasupath.html). I did my bachelors in Applied Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad in 2014. I did my masters in Statistics from Rutgers University in 2017. I worked as a Business Analyst in EXL services in Gurgaon, India from 2014-2016 and as a statistician at Encore Capital Group form 2018 to 2019 in San Diego, CA.


Research Interest
======
   1. <b>Deep Reinforcement Learning</b> - I am primarily interested in the analysis and application of reinforcement learning (RL), with a particular focus on algorithms that leverage neural networks and operate over large action spaces. My work analyzes these algorithms and proposes improvements to reduce their sample complexity.

   2. <b>Bi-level Reinforcement Learning\ RLHF</b> - I aim to develop novel, provably converegent bi-level algorithms for application to RLHF setups.
    
   3. <b>Diffusion Models\textbackslash Flow Matching</b> - I am interested in the theoretical analyses of diffusion models and flow mathcing algorithsm. I am also interested in the application of these algorithms to offline RL methods.
